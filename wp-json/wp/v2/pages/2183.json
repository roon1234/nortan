Web servers, the computers that \u201cserve\u201d web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Company collects IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to third parties and to track the use of the Site. When visitors request pages from the Site or click on a link in a mailing sent through the Service our server\u2019s log the visitors\u2019 IP addresses.
